Story: The King of Spain has sent out an expedition to the New World to explore and map the continent. 
After months at sea the party arrives somewhere in South America. 
After the first scouting party was sent out and did not return yet, the captain has selected you to select a small party of other willing crew members for a second scouting party. 

Setting: The jungles and mountains of South America in the 1500-1600 period. 
Native American temples and ruins exist to explore within the jungle. 
Grounded mainly in reality, but features fantasy elements as well, like spirits, zombies, some magic, gods, and other phenomenon. 

Characters: 
Player- Generic avatar
Pirate
Healer
Fencer
Rifleman
etc.


Mechanics: Traditional RPG elements exist. 
Each character has a unique class and abilities to go along with it. 
Main feature of the game is the talk system. 
At the beginning of the game you talk with the crew members. 
Based on your dialogue choices they will tell you whether or not they want to join you on the expedition. 
Once on the expedition, at the end of each day you will have a “campfire chat” with your fellow explorers which will have dialogue options and will determine your team’s actions the next day. 
The chats will reveal more about the characters and their motivations/backgrounds as well. 
The game is shorter compared to other RPGs, but has high replay value in choosing new party members, as well as lots of branching events based on the results of the fireside conversations.
