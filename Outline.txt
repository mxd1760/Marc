Let's make a Game!

We Meet on Sundays at 4:00 Pm
We use Unity for the Game Dev Stuff
We Use Blender for the Modeling/Animation stuff (.fbx is the format used for files)

Team Roles:
	Marcus: Guy A
	Mark.M: Guy 1
	Mark.S: Guy 1st
	

Project Goals:
	Setup: (get a system working)
	Brainstorming: (What kind of game do we want?)
	Make A Prototype: (Unclear)
		RPG:

Project Updates:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 11/08/2020

Done:	Marcus: - I've made a demo platformer in godot
	Mark.S: - I've brainstormed about how we might be able to make our platformer work as a rhythm game
	Mark.M: - I've been brainstorming about mechanics that might help make our platformer more mechanichally engaging. 
Doing:	Marcus: - I think I'm going to try and work to retool my platformer into a more sidescroller type version that can then support the 
		new mechanical ideas a bit better.
	Mark.S: - I'm going to be working on the systems that would be used to impliment the rhythm game aspects into the game.
	Mark.M: - I'm going to work on theming ideas and assets for the game.
Goals:  - I think next week we'll want to have improved on our prototypes and such. I think it would also behoove us to have a better idea as
	to how we're going to retool this git repository in order to share our new godot based project as opposed to the old unity stuff.

Date 10/04/2020

Done:	Marcus: - I've been going extremely slowly in past weeks compared to before then with the character designs due to other life things.
	Mark.S: - 
	Mark.M: - 
Doing:	Marcus: - I'm planning to try and foce myself to just do work more often even if it's less quality, more work will mean things will get done
		with enough time at the end to fix the things that need to be done better.
	Mark.S: - 
	Mark.M: - 
Goals:	 - A prototype was our first goal but we still haven't reached it. I think we should reconsider what our goals actually are and how we plan to 
	achieve them. If nothing else This first few months might have been enough to get our toes wet enough to know what we need going in for round 2. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 08/16/2020

Done:	Marcus: - I've kinda been slacking on the charachter design practice. I've also been learning about a different game engine for work but when
		I'm done with that I can focus on the 3D modeling stuff because it will be useful for both this project and my godot work for work.
	Mark.S: - 
	Mark.M: - Trying to work on the story and setting for the intro.
Doing:	Marcus: - I'm hoping to finish my godot learning and then just crap out a couple of charachters to use.
	Mark.S: - 
	Mark.M: - Mark hopes to finish up with his starting area stuff. 
Goals:	We might need to Reconvine in the near future to try and reorient ourselves. I think that trying to focus on a short demo instead of a full game to start
	with will help us feel out our roles a bit better without being so hesitant due to uncertanty. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date; 07/26/2020

Done:	Marcus: - Since last time i've been working on learning how to make characters

	Mark.S: - Mark plans to continue working toward getting a functional demo up and running.
	Mark.M: - Presumably he's still working on some lore type things. 
Goals:		Get a Demo up and running and be prepared to get full into preproduction/production.
