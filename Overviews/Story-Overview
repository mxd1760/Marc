Story Overview: 
The game follows a Portuguese expedition to South America in the late 1500s/early 1600s. 
The expedition arrives in the Northern half of the Portoguese empire in South America (what is now Brazil). 
The expedition was chartered by the King of Portugal and on paper has the intent of mapping the region and finding a place to begin construction of new towns and cities in the New World. 
However, the captain of the expedition, as well as some of the others, have gone on this journey with the intent of finding “El Dorado” or the city of gold in South America.

The expedition has constructed a camp near the shores where they landed and have been there for a few weeks. 
The first scouting party that was sent out when they landed has not returned. 
The captain has selected you to find other crew members to join you for a second scouting expedition.
